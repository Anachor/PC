## Setup
-  Install dependencies:
``pip install -r requirements.txt``

## Input Format


To run the scripts, we will need three files as input:

### 1.  circuit_file

This file contains the circuit to be computed. It also contains which inputs are assigned to Alice and which to Bob.

<details>

<summary>Format</summary>

- The file starts with a description of the circuit
    - Each line contains a gate or a terminal (A terminal simply means a input)
    - terminals are represented as `term <name>`.
    - gates are represented as 
       - binary gates: `<gate_type> <input1> <input2> <identifier>` 
       - unary gates: `<gate_type> <input> <identifier>`
       - `identifier` is an identifier for the gate used for later inputs
       - each `<input>` should be a previusly defined terminal or gate 
- The gate description ends with a line describing the output in the format `output <identifier>`
   - `identifier` is the identifier of the gate that produces the output and must be previously defined.
- Finally, the file ends with two lines:
   - `a1 a2 ... an` where `a0`, `a1`, `a2` are the identifiers of the inputs assigned to alice
   - `b1 b2 ... bm` where `b0`, `b1`, `b2` are the identifiers of the inputs assigned to bob
- Empty lines and lines starting with `#` are ignored. So, we can add comments to the file using `#`
- Allowed gates are and, or, not.

<summary>Example</summary>

  ```
  # This is a comment
  term a0
  term a1
  term b0
  term b1
    
  not a0 na0
  and na0 a1 x
  and b0 b1 b
  or x b out
    
  output out
    
  a0 a1
  b0 b1
  ```

</details>


### 2. alice_assignment_file

This file contains the values assigned to alice's inputs. It should contain assignments for all inputs assigned to alice in the circuit file.

**Format**: Each line contains `input_name value`. Empty lines and lines starting with `#` are ignored.

**Example**:

```
a0 1
a1 0
```
  
### 3. bob_assignment_file
Similar to `alice_assignment_file`, but for bob's inputs. 
## Scripts
There are two scripts to run:
### 1. **bob.py**
This script acts as bob and uses `circuit_file` and `bob_assignment_file`. In addition, it also acts as the server for communication with alice

**Usage**: `python bob.py <port> <circuit_file> <bob_assignment_file> [--verbose]`

**Example**: `python bob.py 12345 circuit.txt bob.txt --verbose`

### 2. **alice.py**
This script acts as alice and uses `circuit_file` and `alice_assignment_file`. It acts as the client for communication with bob

**Usage:** `python alice.py <ip> <port> <circuit_file> <alice_assignment_file> [--verbose]`

Here ip and port are the ip and port of bob.py.

**Example**: `python alice.py localhost 12345 circuit.txt alice.txt --verbose`

## Quick Testing Scripts

### **run.sh**
If we are running both scripts on the same machine, we can use the script `run.sh` to run both scripts in parallel.

First we put the three files in the same directoory and name them as `circuit.txt`, `bob.txt` and `alice.txt`. 
Then we run the script as follows:
```./run.sh <port> <directory>```

### **stresstester.py**
This script can be used to test the protocol for multiple assignments.

For each possible assignment of the inputs, the script will calculate the output of the circuit using two methods: 
direct evaluation of the circuit and garbled circuit protocol using alice.py and bob.py
and report if the outputs differ for any assignment.

Usage: ```python stresstester.py <testcase_folder> <port> [iterations]```
Example: ```python stresstester.py testcases/millionaire2 12345 10```

This will run the protocol for 10 random assignments for the 2 bit millionaire problem.
If no iterations are provided, it will run for all possible assignments.


## Testcases:
There are three testcases in the `testcases` directory. 
- `millionaire2` is the millionaire problem with 2 bits.
- `millionaire4` is the millionaire problem with 4 bits.
- `mux` is a simple 4 bit multiplexer.

Example:
```./run.sh 12345 testcases/millionaire2```



## Running via GitHub Actions

A github action "Garbled Circuits Demonstration" is available. To run, go to the **Actions** tab, select **"Garbled Circuits Demonstration"** and click **‚ÄúRun workflow‚Äù**. The inputs are:
   - `testcase`: Name of the test (e.g., `millionaire2`, `millionaire4`, `mux`)
   - `alice_inputs`: Alice's inputs. Use `\n` to separate lines. Example: "a1 1\na0 0"
   - `bob_inputs`: Bob's input. Same format as above
   - `verbose`: Optional, default is `true`

There should be a folder './testcases/<testcase>/' with the a circuit.txt file describing the circuit. Three testcases are already provided in the `testcases` folder. The testcases are:
- `millionaire2`: 2 bit millionaire problem
- `millionaire4`: 4 bit millionaire problem
- `mux`: 4 bit multiplexer

To add a new testcase, create a folder with the name of the testcase and add a `circuit.txt` file with the description of the circuit. The format is the same as described above. All inputs should be assigned to exactly one of alice or bob.
